# 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array [![share]](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)

![][easy]

## Problem Statement:

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the **first part** of the array `nums`. More formally, if there are `k` elements after removing the duplicates, then the first `k` elements of `nums` should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first `k` elements.

Return `k` after placing the final result in the first `k` slots of `nums`.

Do **not** allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by **modifying the input array** in-place with O(1) extra memory.

### Custom Judge:

```
The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
```

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.

### Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

### Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 3 \* 10<sup>4</sup>
- -100 <= nums[i] <= 100
- nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.

## Solution:

::: code-group

```py [Python]
def removeDuplicates(nums: list[int]) -> int:
    k = 0
    for i, item in enumerate(nums):
        if i < len(nums) - 1 and item == nums[i + 1]:
            continue
        nums[k] = item
        k += 1
    return k

```

```go [Go]
package main

func removeDuplicates(nums []int) int {
	k := 0
	for i := 1; i < len(nums); i++ {
		if nums[i] != nums[k] {
			k++
			nums[k] = nums[i]
		}
	}

	return k + 1
}

```
